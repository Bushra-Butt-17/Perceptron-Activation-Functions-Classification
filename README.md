# Perceptron-Activation-Functions-Classification
This repository implements and compares different Perceptron models using various activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU. The models are trained and evaluated on a synthetic binary classification dataset, and the accuracy of each model is measured.
